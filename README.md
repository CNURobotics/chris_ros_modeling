### ROS Model-based Engineering Tools

### Description

Within this repository are Python-based [ROS](http://www.ros.org) modeling tools that
can be used to capture of software model of a ROS Workspace and running ROS deployment.

The captured model can be loaded, manipulated, and exported for documentation or use
in so called Model Integrated Computing (MIC) or Model Driven Engineering (MDE).

This repository includes the following packages:
* `chris_ros_modeling`       - ROS Entity metamodel classes and tools for
                               marshalling/unmarshalling instances of these
                               metamodels (model)
* `chris_package_modeler`    - tool to capture specification model of existing ROS
                               workspace
* `chris_ros_snapshot`       - tools to capture models from currently running ROS
                               deployments
* `chris_haros_model_merger` - tool to merge CHRIS Models with HAROS Models in an
                               attempt to create unified and comprehensive models
* `chris_rrbot_modeling`     - a demo model based on the
                               [RRBot](https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_demos)

### Initial Setup

Currently these modules require Python 2.7+, so please make sure it is installed.
> Note: The projects are currently incompatible with Python 3 due to the nature of the ROS-based dependencies.
>  Future work will upgrade to Python 3

The Python executables require `apt`, `PyYAML`, and `graphviz` packages. Use
<pre>
pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre>
> NOTE: Currently `apt` should be installed via `sudo apt install python-apt`


Once this project has been cloned into your [Catkin](https://docs.ros.org/api/catkin/html) Workspace, run the
following commands:
- `catkin build` (or similar catkin build command)
- `source <catkin_ws_location>/setup.bash` (your `.bashrc` may handle this automatically on shell restart)

From here, the packages should be available for use with `rosrun` (see the project specific `README`s for more
detail).

### Known issues

This project is an ongoing development effort and may be subject to future changes.

See the individual project READMEs for specific information.

On going work intends to incorporate HAROS static code analysis and enable export
of these models to other MIC/MDE tools.
